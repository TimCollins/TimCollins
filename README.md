### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on front-end UI design patterns using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui)
- 📚 I’m re-reading Steve McConnell's [Code Complete](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/4845.Code_Complete). It's old but still full of useful information
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET Core and C# mostly but I also dabble in JavaScript from time to time as required
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about recent C# language features such as [asynchronous streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/generate-consume-asynchronous-stream)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like obscure quotes from The Simpsons. Oh and once I saw a blimp!
- 🖼️ I ❤️ the art of [HR Giger](https://hrgiger.com/)
- 🎵 I’m currently listening to Lost Forever // Lost Together by [Architects](https://architectsofficial.com/)
