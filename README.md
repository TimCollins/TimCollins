### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on asynchronous data access functionality using Azure Storage
- 📚 I’m reading Kent Beck's [Test Driven Development by Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development)
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET Core and C# mostly but I also dabble in JavaScript from time to time as required
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about recent C# language features such as [asynchronous streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/generate-consume-asynchronous-stream)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like obscure quotes from The Simpsons. Oh and once I saw a blimp!
- 🖼️ I ❤️ the art of [HR Giger](https://hrgiger.com/)
- 🎵 I’m currently listening to [Siege](https://mechinamusic.bandcamp.com/album/siege) by [Mechina](https://www.mechinamusic.com/)
