- 📚 I’m re-reading [Witches Abroad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2442.Witches_Abroad) by Terry Pratchett
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET Core and C# mostly but I also dabble in JavaScript from time to time as required
- 🌱 I’m reading [MonoGame Mastery](https://www.amazon.co.uk/MonoGame-Mastery-Multi-Platform-Reusable-Engine/dp/1484263081) and attempting to use my C# knowledge to implement some very basic games
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like obscure quotes from The Simpsons. Oh and once I saw a blimp!
